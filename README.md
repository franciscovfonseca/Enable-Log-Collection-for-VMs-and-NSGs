<br />

<br />

In this lab we're going to finish the configuration to allow our Logs from the Virtual Machines to be sent into our Log Analytics Workspace, along with the actual Network Security Groups.

After we make the necessary configurations, we'll **Query our LAW (using KQL)** for the Linux Logs, the Windows Logs as well as the NSG Logs.

This way we'll make sure that all of our Logs are coming into our Central Repository.

<br>

We will go to our **Azure Portal** ‚ûú search for **Storage Account** ‚ûú and click **"Create storage account"**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5efd94ea-5bb1-440e-af0a-cb50d46a19ed)

You can set it up with this details (or similar if applicable):
- **Resource group**: ```RG-Cyber-Lab```
- **Storage account name**: ```sacyberlab999``` ‚ûú it has to be globally unique
- **Region**: ```East US 2``` ‚ûú ‚ö†Ô∏è make sure you put it in the **Same Region as you VMs**, otherwise it won't work!
- Leave everything else as it is

Click **"Create"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e290340-27f6-43d2-bf13-afba7cefeeaf)

üí° Again, this will be used to store what's called the **"NSG Flow Logs"** ‚ûú there're essentially Logs from the Firewalls.

<br>

We'll just go to **"Network security groups"** in the **Azure Portal**.

And then we'll first click on the **"windows-vm-nsg"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f18036aa-2c1c-450d-8f6e-41ff6d1e7c26)

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/796cb1b1-b16b-46c8-9aca-75487bd045bc)

We can actually create the Flow Log Settings for both of the NSGs' Flow Logs at the same time.

To do so, we'll click on ‚ûï **Select resource** ‚ûú and after we'll select ‚òëÔ∏è both the **windows-vm-nsg** and the **linux-vm-nsg**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d3c3760-6414-4ba6-b16f-6812647fb6be)

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2194b97-aef5-49ad-b9bc-47decc77fdaf)

For the **Analytics** tab:
- **Flow Logs Version**: ```‚¶ø Version 2```

<br>

To **Configure Data Collection Rules (DCR)** we can go to our Log Analytics Workspace ```LAW-Cyber-Lab-01```

We'll click on the **"Agents"** blade ‚ûú and the on the **"Data Collection Rules"** Button:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a684f65-750d-458a-981d-7f5d7bee42f1)

Then click on ‚ûï **Create** to create a new DCR:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e13bb6ac-9ece-4108-bdcc-0fd7d3386a00)

We'll create it with the following details:
- **Rule Name**: ```dcr-all-vms``` ‚ûú üí° this stands for 1 single DCR that will apply to all of our VMs
- **Resource group**: ```RG-Cyber-Lab```
- **Region**: ```East US 2``` ‚ûú ‚ö†Ô∏è again, make sure you put it in the **Same Region as you VMs**, otherwise it won't work!
- **Platform Type**: ‚¶ø **All**

Then click "Next" to reach the **Resources** tab:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/010af302-782a-4c56-9a0f-80ca5574ded1)

For the Resources we're going to ‚ûï **Add Resources**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45dfe720-c3fc-491a-9bef-7eaf3997f227)

Now expand the **> RG-Cyber Lab** Resource Group ‚ûú and select ‚òëÔ∏è for both of our VMs ‚ûú click **"Apply"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbf4b74a-94ae-4b99-8692-9566f2952cc0)

Click **"Next: Collect and deliver >"**

üí° This is where we'll specify which Logs from within the VMs we're going to collect.

So we'll click on the ‚ûï **Add data source** button:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a302a685-643c-468d-9d47-44042b329685)

We'll do the **"Linux Syslog"** first.

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29944fe1-85ea-4c4a-b1bf-2b50e6325277)

In this Lab, the only Logs we're going to Collect from the Linux VM are the ```LOG_AUTH``` Logs.

>   <details close>

So for **LOG_AUTH** ‚ûú leave the **"Minimum log level"** at ```LOG_DEBUG``` ‚ûú meaning we'll collect all the Auth Logs.

And then we'll select ```LOG_DEBUG``` for the rest of the Log Types.

After setting that up, click on the **"Next : Destination"** button:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c54a7ba-a867-468b-b987-7ba980c2c851)

For **Destination** ‚ûú make sure you're sending the data to your actual **LAW**, not the random one that was created! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Click **"Add data source"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07a7a358-78fa-4e5a-b6da-aa19b4b18e6b)

Now click on the ‚ûï **Add data source** button again:

The next one is going to be **"Windows Event Logs"**.

We're going to select the ‚òëÔ∏è **Information** Logs from **"Application"** type.

And also select the ‚òëÔ∏è **Audit Success** & ‚òëÔ∏è **Audit Failure** Logs from the **"Security"** type.

This is all we need for the Windows Event Logs, so then we'll click on **"Next : Destination"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a178e78d-c2ad-49f2-897d-b32724a8bcfd)

Again ‚ûú for **Destination** ‚ûú we need to make sure we put our actual LAW ```LAW-Cyber-Lab-01```.

Then Add the data source:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/294f285c-d6a4-4365-b131-c1631a60fcb8)

We can now **"Review + create"** to Create the Data Collection Rule:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/060a1a2d-865a-48e7-b6f0-344431c85332)

We want to configure our **Data Collection Rule** so that:

1. If Malware is discovered ‚ûú a Log is created and it's forwarded into our Log Analytics Workspace:

Copy the following **Windows Defender Malware Detection XPath Query**.

```commandline
Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational!*[System[(EventID=1116 or EventID=1117)]]

<br>

Back to our **Log Analytics Wokspace** ‚ûú click on the **"Agents"** blade

We're first going to Install the Agent on the ```windows-vm``` ‚ûú so under the **"`Windows servers"** tab ‚ûú expand the **"Log Analytics agent instructions"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51c87b0a-aad5-4daa-aa85-103770ba116d)

> 
>   </details>

<br>

So let's Connect to the **Windows Vm** ‚ûú open **Microsoft Remote Desktop** ‚ûú and then connect with the VM's Public IP Address (which we've done many times before in previous labs):

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19dcdcc3-563e-4d32-9624-052fc3934d89)

Use your credentials:
- **Username**: ```labuser```
- **Password**: ```Cyberlab123!```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f316622-9025-4bf9-aa00-50dc05018c6b)

Once connected to the Windows Vm ‚ûú go back to the Azure Portal on your Computer and copy the "Download link" to **Install the Agent on the Windows VM**.

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55410b99-a755-442d-9c1a-b179dfcc8959)

Now in the Windows Vm ‚ûú open up **"Edge"** ‚ûú Paste the Link & Download the Agent:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/737fce37-39b2-4612-bdde-088b625550cb)

You can Open the File ‚ûú and click **"Next"** until you reach the section where you want to select:

```‚òëÔ∏è Connect the agent to Azure Log Analytics (OMS)```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfb6d974-420d-47b1-a745-d4c489bd29e3)

In the next section ‚ûú Paste the **Workspace ID** & **Workspace Key** you Copied from the Azure Portal back in your Computer:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06e2ef7a-f4aa-48e1-88d3-57c9ac7aa934)

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure **"Azure Cloud"** is set to ```Azure Commercial```

Click **"Next and then **"Install"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8681207-f4a9-4025-ac69-510569c744b8)

Once the Agent has finished Installing ‚ûú still inside the **Windows VM** ‚ûú open **Control Panel**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53416129-0420-4b7f-b4bf-9228168ff48c)

Click on **"Large Icons"** ‚ûú and then **"Microsoft Monitoring Agent"**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c0d97be-868d-4c8f-9a23-6518764288c4)

Then if we go to the **"Azure Log Analytics (OMS)"** tab ‚ûú and we should see:

- The Workspace ID we pasted earlier

- The status: ```‚úÖ The Microsoft Monitoring Agent has successfully connected to the Microsoft Operations Management Suite service.```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9fafa49-dcd1-43dc-b1dd-6f46cc02d672)

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8897b4c9-c21a-4f78-b44a-5751c3933180)

Go back to the **Terminal App** ‚ûú **Paste the Command** ‚ûú and **Run It** (Press Enter):

This will:
- Download the Script

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fdb4693-ca42-4b20-b989-d973e3aba495)

It should now install the **Log Analytics Agent** locally with a ```status code 0``` at the end:

To make sure the Logs are coming in from all 3 sources, we'll Query the different **Tables**.

1. The Table that is used to store the **Linux Logs** is called **Syslog**.

We should be able to type ```Syslog``` ‚ûú and click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **"Run"** Button to Query the Syslog Log:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbb34900-5811-4498-b23d-a75178bb0a11)

‚úÖ Looks like the **Linux VM Logs** are actually coming in ‚ûú so we know it's working.

<br>

<br>

2. The Table (aka the Excel Spreadsheet) that is used to hold the Logs from our Windows VMs is called **SecurityEvent**

So next we're going to inspect the ```SecurityEvent``` Logs:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b4f4b61-932e-4beb-86e3-cb002925badc)

‚úÖ We can see the SecurityEvent Logs are coming in ‚ûú which is great!

3. The last Table is used to hold the NSG Logs ‚ûú **AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL**

Again ‚ûú inside the LAW's **"Logs"** Blade ‚ûú Paste the command ```AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL``` and Run the Query:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8bf7908-0bf0-484e-b2ca-47aa5b9731de)

‚úÖ And we can see that the NSG Logs did come in.

# Summary

<br>

Just to recap, in this lab we:

1. Created an **Azure Storage Account** for the Network Security Groups‚Äô Flow Logs.

2. Enabled **NSG Flow Logs**.

3. Created **Data Collection Rules** to specify which Logs to collect from our Windows and Linux VMs.

4. Manually installed the **Log Analytics Agent** locally on the Virtual Machines.

5. **ueried the Log Analytics Workspace** for our VMs Logs and for our NSGs Logs ‚ûú to see if they were showing up there.

<br>

After completing this lab, we are now successfully sending Logs from both the VMs and the NSGs into the Log Analytics Workspace.

This is why we can Query things like Syslog and see all the Linux VM Logs.

In subsequent labs we‚Äôll do the same thing for our other resources as well as for our **Microsoft Entra ID Logs**.
